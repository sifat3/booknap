    <h3>Psychology</h3>
    <p>Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.</p>

    <h3>Astrophysics/Astronomy/Cosmology</h3>
    <p>Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to seek to understand the universe and our place in it.

The field explores topics such as the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe. It has two sibling sciences, astronomy and cosmology, though the lines between these branches can blur. </p>
